RepRap x-ends for Misumi Leadscrew/Nut and Acetal Bushings.

This is a modified version of the popular prusa/mendelmax x-ends for use with acetal bushings from SDP and Misumi leadscrew/nut combination. It's based on the 1.1 x-end version at thingiverse.com/thing:21122. The only modifications are to allow for a flanged leadscrew nut and acetal bushings instead of LM8UUs.

Instructions If you're not familiar with the x-axis of a reprap, you can learn more at reprap.org/wiki/Mendel_X-axis.

Assembly instructions for this part are like other x-ends, of which there are many variations. Refer to the excellent instrutions posted at reprap.org/wiki/LongboatPrusa#Instructions_11, note the variations in this part, and you should have enough to complete assembly. Let me know if you have questions!

There are two basic changes:
1) Substitutes a 8mm Misumi leadscrew for oft-used cheap drill rod. Uses a flanged nut that's bolted through with two bolts.
2) Uses acetal bushings with 17.5mm OD for the z-axis smooth-rod, typically 8mm. For example, the bushings at sdp-si.com/eStore/Direct.asp?GroupID=469
